                            <p>The traditional Tegalalang Rice Terraces are just about half an hour north of Ubud, in the Tegalalang Village. The whole community pitches in to maintain the paddies’ complex irrigation system, which is centuries old. They
                                also let tourists in to wander the terraces for free.</p>

                                sun and the crowds. This is probably the time we were happiest to not be on a tour bus—our driver managed to get us there before the crowds arrived.

                                the menu offers a mash-up of French, Italian, and Mediterranean dishes and flavors. Basically, there’s something for everyone, whether you want a refreshing salad, pasta, or something a little heartier. It also has many
                                vegetarian options and is budget-friendly! I can recommend the steak sandwich with fries if it’s on the menu.</p>

                            <p>The Monkey Temple is pretty much exactly what it sounds like—temples in the jungle that are home to hundreds of monkeys. This highly visited point of interest is also known as the Monkey Forest, which is pretty telling. For
                                some, the monkeys are even more of a draw than the temples! <span class="textcolor">The interiors to the temples aren’t open to the public</span>, but you can have a stroll around the grounds and get in some quality time

                            about a potentially dangerous monkey bite is no one’s idea of a fun vacation activity, but you should be fine as long as you avoid feeding or antagonizing the monkeys.</p>

                                too. If you’re looking to do some shopping—and really, why not?—I would definitely set aside an hour, at least, to navigate this market. It’s colorful, chaotic, loud, and crammed with gorgeous goods like batik fabrics,
                                sarongs, hand-woven bags, baskets, and other handicrafts.</p>

                                no charge to admire the architecture and have a walk through the gardens. Of course, the entire Palace isn’t open to the public, but the façade and gardens are! And the palaces makes for beautiful photographs.</p>

                                and it’s a must-see Bali destination. The only caveat to this stop: there’s not a whole lot of shade here, so <span class="textcolor">if you’re visiting in midday—and especially if you’re traveling with kids—it’s a good idea to pack extra water

                            a stone pathway leading up to it from the shore. During high tide, the waters rise to completely surround the temple. It’s a perfect, picturesque way to end a day trip through Bali.
